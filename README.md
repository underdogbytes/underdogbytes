## 📕 My Projects ✨
Yeah, I know how sucks to go into someone's github and wonder: what repo should I open?<br>

## 🪐 About me 🦕🌠 

UI/UX Designer | Software engineer | Idk man LoooL 📺🕹️📷🌱🐛

Hellow ma beloved oness! :D

Well, I'm 27 years old right now, is it been a long time, huh? ≽ ^ • ⩊ • ^ ≼

Nowadays I'm studying 2 courses at college at the same time, drinking more water, exercise a little and being a great time offline. Oh yeah, I still don't make plans for my life hahaha ^-^ I just try to be better than I was yesterday always respecting my own limits.

And perhaps life is this simple and don't need more complicated stuff. And talking about complicated stuff, did you believe me if I said that I started enjoying resolving math problems? hahaha Idk why yet, but it's been fun ^-^

About work, yess, I still only working to pay my bills, prioritizing my mental health above my job, so, yeah, "I'm getting older and I think I'm aging well" hahaha ¸ ¸ ♬ · · ♩ ¸ ¸ ♪ •°

My motto still

```
𝘛𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦'𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘣𝘶𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘦𝘮𝘱𝘵𝘪𝘯𝘦𝘴𝘴.
```

but also
